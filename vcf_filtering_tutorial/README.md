# VCF filtering tutorial

This tutorial shows how to perform standard filtering of a VCF file. It also includes a PCA to explore if there is any structure in the data.

The tutorial was implemented in [Databricks](https://community.cloud.databricks.com). So, you can import the [Genomics&Spark.dbc](Genomics&Spark.dbc) notebook into Databricks and replicate my analysis.
