# Genomic analyses in Apache Spark

This repository includes scrips and pipelines for genomic analyses in [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), an open-source cluster-computing framework for big data processing. The workflow is mostly based on [Hail](https://hail.is), an open-source scalable framework for exploring and analyzing genomic data. Hail is exposed through **Python** and backed by distributed algorithms built on top of Apache Spark.

[vcf_filtering_tutorial](vcf_filtering_tutorial) contains a small tutorial on VFC filtering. It also includes a PCA to explore if there is any structure in the data. The tutorial was implemented in [Databricks](https://community.cloud.databricks.com).
